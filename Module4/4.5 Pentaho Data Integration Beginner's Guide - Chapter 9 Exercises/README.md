## Interesting things that I got

  * [Group By](#group-by) - almost the same thing as in SQL
  * [Database Lookup](#database-lookup) - use it, when we need to add some data from another DB / Table (almost like join)
  * [Database Join](#database-join) - you can join tables from DW with tables from any other source (excel, txt, etc)
