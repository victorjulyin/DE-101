## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS, AWS for instance)
    * User can use Storage, Networks and other fundamental computer resources
    * User doesn't manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure

### Platform as a Service (PaaS, Snowflake or Redshift for instance)
    * User can control the individual application capabilities
    * Doesn't manage or control the cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems and storage

### Software as a Service (SaaS, Google SpreadSheets for instance)
    * User does not manage or control the cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems and storage or even individual application capabilities

## Cloud Deployment Models

### Public Clouds
    * AWS, Azure, GCP - examples of the public clouds
    * Open to use for general public
    * Final users don't have the physical access to the hardware

### Private Clouds
    * Large organisation create its own Cloud
    * Very expensive but sometimes necessary because of the sensitive data for example (banks etc.)

### Hybrid Clouds

### Community Clouds
