### I made a mistake

Thought that it is necessary to make Data Model, DW, connection, visualization etc.
But it was necessary to make only a visualization. So I made some extra work accidentally: [created a Source DB](https://github.com/victorjulyin/DE-101/tree/main/Module3/Practice/Archive/source_creation) :)
