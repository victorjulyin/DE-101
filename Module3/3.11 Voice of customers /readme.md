# My survey
### What is it for?
1) to know which tasks we should perform to help client
2) control quality of the service provided to the client
3) creating progress reports (show problem solving in dynamics)


### What I did
I made a [small survey](https://forms.gle/W14b7hATSmrQXc4a8) on Google Forms, because it is easy to send and comfortable to download the results.
It is quite universal, so I can use it in future.


## Now we can analyse the results
### I went through the form 10 times manually

We can see some summary inside Google Forms
Based on this, the first conclusions can be drawn

### We can see that it is better to use "dropdown" than "short answer" in this field
(2)

### There are some problems with data issues reporting
(3)

### Problems that interfere with employees' work
(4)

### It is better to use some BI-tool to analyse this information
I prefer Tableau
In this case we can look through the Data in different contexts - current reporting tool, department, access to DW etc.
