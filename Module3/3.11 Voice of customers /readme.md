# My survey
### What is it for?
1) to know which tasks we should perform to help client
2) control quality of the service provided to the client
3) creating progress reports (show problem solving in dynamics)


### What I did
I made a [small survey](https://forms.gle/W14b7hATSmrQXc4a8) on Google Forms, because it is easy to send and comfortable to download the results.
It is quite universal, so I can use it in future.


## Now we can analyse the results
### I went through the form 10 times manually
