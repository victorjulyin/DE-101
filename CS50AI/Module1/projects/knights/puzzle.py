'''Add knowledge to knowledge bases knowledge0, knowledge1, knowledge2, and knowledge3 to solve the following puzzles.

In each of the above puzzles, each character is either a knight or a knave. Every sentence spoken by a knight is true, and every sentence spoken by a knave is false.

Once youâ€™ve completed the knowledge base for a problem, you should be able to run python puzzle.py to see the solution to the puzzle.
